- Dealer hits on 16 or less
- Dealer stands on 17 or more
- Blackjack pays 3:2
- **💎 Double Down**: Double your bet and take one card
- **✂️ Split**: Split matching pairs into two hands
- **🛡️ Insurance**: Protect against dealer blackjack when showing Ace

**Betting Mode Features:**
- Set your starting bankroll
- Place bets each round
- Track session statistics including doubles, splits, and insurance
- See your profit/loss in real-time

### Run AI Tournament
```bash
# Run 1000 rounds with default agents
node --loader ../../test/ts-esm-loader.js agents/tournament.js

# Run 5000 rounds with specific seed
node --loader ../../test/ts-esm-loader.js agents/tournament.js 5000 42

# Arguments: [rounds] [seed]
```

Watch different AI strategies compete:
- **Basic Strategy**: Follows simplified basic strategy rules
- **Conservative**: Stands on 17+
- **Aggressive**: Stands on 19+
- **Always Hit**: Hits until bust (for comparison)

## Features

### 💰 Betting System

Complete bankroll and chip management integrated into all game modes:

**Features:**
- Initial bankroll configuration
- Bet placement with min/max limits
- Payout calculations (3:2 for blackjack, 1:1 for wins)
- Session statistics tracking
- Broke detection

**Betting Strategies:**
- **Flat Betting**: Always bet the same amount
- **Martingale**: Double bet after loss, reset after win
- **Percentage**: Bet a percentage of current bankroll
- **Progressive**: Increase bet after wins
- **Kelly Criterion**: Optimal bet sizing based on player edge and variance
- **Oscar's Grind**: Progressive system with profit targets and cycle tracking

**Usage:**
```javascript
import { BettingManager, KellyCriterionStrategy, OscarsGrindStrategy } from './blackjack-betting.js';

const betting = new BettingManager(1000, { minBet: 5, maxBet: 500 });
betting.placeBet(25);
const payout = betting.resolveBet('agent'); // Win!
console.log(betting.getStats());

// Advanced strategies
const kellyStrategy = new KellyCriterionStrategy(0.005, 0.005);
const oscarStrategy = new OscarsGrindStrategy(10, 10);
const betSize = kellyStrategy.getBetSize(gameState, betting, null, trueCount);
```

### 👥 Multi-Agent Support

Play with 2-6 agents at a single table:

**Features:**
- Support for 2-6 agents
- Individual bankrolls and betting
- Sequential turn-taking
- Automatic dealer play after all agents finish
- Per-agent statistics
- Network multiplayer support

**Usage:**
```javascript
import { Engine } from '../../engine/Engine.js';
import { MultiagentBlackjackGame } from './multiagent-game.js';

const engine = new Engine();
const game = new MultiagentBlackjackGame(engine, {
  isHost: true,
  numAgents: 3,
  agentNames: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol'],
  initialBankroll: 1000
});

// Agents place bets
engine._agents.forEach(agent => agent.resources.currentBet = 10);

game.deal();
game.hit();   // Current agent hits
game.stand(); // Current agent stands
```

## How It Works

### Token-Based Cards

Each card is a Token with metadata:
```json
{
  "id": "hearts-ace",
  "group": "hearts",
  "label": "A",
  "meta": {
    "suit": "hearts",
    "rank": "A",
    "value": [1, 11],
    "color": "red"
  },
  "char": "🂱"
}
```

### Game Flow

1. **Initialization**
   - Create Source with 6 stacks (standard casino rules)
   - Shuffle with optional seed for deterministic play
   - Setup Space with agent/dealer zones
   - Initialize betting managers for each agent

2. **Betting Phase** *(NEW!)*
   - Agents place bets within min/max limits
   - Card counting agents adjust bet sizes based on count

3. **Deal Phase**
   - 2 cards to each agent (both face up)
   - 2 cards to dealer (one face down)
   - Check for immediate blackjack

4. **Agent Turns** *(Sequential in multi-agent)*
   - Hit or Stand
   - Automatic bust detection via RuleEngine
   - Card counting agents update their count

5. **Dealer Turn**
   - Reveal hidden card
   - Auto-play using rules (hit on 16, stand on 17)

6. **Resolution**
   - Compare hands
   - Determine winners
   - Calculate and distribute payouts

### Rule Engine Integration

The RuleEngine automatically enforces game logic:
```javascript
// Auto-check for agent bust after hit
ruleEngine.addRule(
  "agent-bust-check",
  (engine, lastAction) => {
    if (lastAction.type !== "blackjack:hit") return false;
    const cards = engine.space.zone("agent-hand").map(p => p.card);
    return isBusted(cards);
  },
  (engine) => {
    engine.dispatch("blackjack:agent-busted", {});
  },
  { priority: 100 }
);
```

### Deterministic Replay

Use seeds to replay exact games:
```javascript
const game = new BlackjackGame({ seed: 12345 });
// Game will play identically every time with seed 12345
```

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Betting System Integration
```javascript
// Initialize with betting
const game = new BlackjackGame({ 
  initialBankroll: 1000,
  minBet: 5,
  maxBet: 500
});

// Place bet before dealing
game.deal(betAmount);

// Payout calculated automatically
const state = game.stand();
console.log(state.payout); // { bet, payout, netGain, bankroll }
```

### 2. Multi-agent Management
```javascript
// Agents take turns sequentially
while (!gameState.allAgentsFinished) {
  const currentAgent = game.getCurrentAgent();
  // Current agent makes decision
  game.hit(); // or game.stand()
}
// Dealer plays automatically after all agents finish
```

## Casino Features (Fully Implemented!) 🎰

HyperToken Blackjack now includes a complete casino experience with all advanced play options:

### 💎 Double Down
Double your bet and receive exactly one more card, then automatically stand:
```javascript
// In CLI: Press 'd' when you have exactly 2 cards
game.doubleDown();

// The implementation:
// 1. Doubles the current bet
// 2. Draws exactly one card
// 3. Automatically stands
// 4. Resolves with doubled payout
```

### ✂️ Split
When you have two cards of the same rank, split them into two separate hands:
```javascript
// In CLI: Press 'l' when you have a matching pair
game.split();

// The implementation:
// 1. Checks for matching card ranks
// 2. Places additional bet equal to original
// 3. Creates separate hand zones
// 4. Deals one card to each hand
// 5. Resolves each hand independently
```

### 🛡️ Insurance
When dealer shows an Ace, take insurance to protect against dealer blackjack:
```javascript
// In CLI: Press 'i' when dealer shows Ace
game.takeInsurance();

// The implementation:
// 1. Allows bet up to half the original wager
// 2. If dealer has blackjack, insurance pays 2:1
// 3. If dealer doesn't have blackjack, insurance bet is lost
// 4. Original hand still resolves normally
```

These features are available in:
- ✅ Single-player CLI (`cli.js`)
- ✅ Multi-agent games (`multiagent-game.js`)
- ✅ Network multiplayer (`client.js` / `server.js`)
- ✅ All game modes with full betting integration

### 🎰 Side Bets
Optional side bets add extra excitement and payout opportunities:

**Perfect Pairs** - Bet on whether your first two cards will be a pair:
```javascript
game.placePerfectPairsBet(10); // Place $10 side bet
game.deal();
const sideBetResults = game.resolveSideBets();

// Payouts:
// - Mixed Pair (different colors): 5:1
// - Colored Pair (same color, different suits): 10:1
// - Perfect Pair (same suit): 30:1
```

**21+3** - Bet on a 3-card poker hand (your 2 cards + dealer's up card):
```javascript
game.place21Plus3Bet(10); // Place $10 side bet
game.deal();
const sideBetResults = game.resolveSideBets();

// Payouts:
// - Flush: 5:1
// - Straight: 10:1
// - Three of a Kind: 30:1
// - Straight Flush: 40:1
// - Suited Three of a Kind: 100:1
```

**Lucky Ladies** - Bet on your first two cards totaling 20:
```javascript
game.placeLuckyLadiesBet(10); // Place $10 side bet
game.deal();
// Resolved after hand ends (needs to check for dealer blackjack)
const results = game.resolveDealerDependentSideBets();

// Payouts:
// - Any 20: 4:1
// - Suited 20: 9:1
// - Matched 20 (same rank & suit): 19:1
// - Queen of Hearts Pair: 125:1
// - Q♥ Pair + Dealer Blackjack: 1000:1
```

**Buster Blackjack** - Bet on the dealer busting:
```javascript
game.placeBusterBlackjackBet(10); // Place $10 side bet
game.deal();
// Resolved after dealer plays
const results = game.resolveDealerDependentSideBets();

// Payouts:
// - 3-card bust: 2:1
// - 4-card bust: 4:1
// - 5-card bust: 12:1
// - 6-card bust: 50:1
// - 7-card bust: 100:1
// - 8+ card bust: 250:1
```

### ♻️ Re-Splitting
Split again when you receive another matching card:
```javascript
// Initial split
game.split(); // Split first pair

// If you get another pair on one of the split hands
game.reSplit(0); // Re-split hand #0

// Maximum 4 hands total
// Each hand requires an additional bet equal to the original wager
```

### 🏳️ Early Surrender
Surrender before the dealer checks for blackjack - more favorable to the player:
```javascript
const game = new BlackjackGame({ allowEarlySurrender: true });
game.deal();

// Can surrender immediately after deal, before any other action
if (gameState.canEarlySurrender) {
  game.earlySurrender();  // Forfeit half bet, hand ends immediately
}

// Key differences from late surrender:
// - Available BEFORE dealer checks for blackjack
// - Can surrender even when dealer shows Ace or 10 (might have BJ)
// - More player-favorable (reduces house edge by ~0.39%)
// - Must be used immediately after deal, before hit/stand/double/split
```

### 🏳️ Late Surrender
Surrender after the dealer checks for blackjack:
```javascript
const game = new BlackjackGame({ allowLateSurrender: true });
game.deal();

// Late surrender available after insurance phase
if (gameState.canSurrender) {
  game.surrender();  // Forfeit half bet
}

// Key differences from early surrender:
// - Available AFTER dealer checks for blackjack
// - If dealer has blackjack, player loses full bet (no surrender option)
// - Less favorable than early surrender but still useful
```

### 🇪🇺 European Blackjack Variant
Play European-style blackjack with different dealer card rules:
```javascript
const game = new BlackjackGame({ variant: 'european' });

// Key differences from American blackjack:
// - Dealer receives only 1 card initially (face up)
// - Dealer's hole card dealt AFTER all players finish
// - No insurance available (dealer doesn't show potential blackjack early)
// - If dealer gets blackjack, all double/split bets are lost
```

## Performance

On a typical laptop:
- 1,000 rounds: ~1-2 seconds
- 10,000 rounds: ~10-15 seconds
- 100,000 rounds: ~2 minutes

The bottleneck is rule evaluation. For high-performance sims, cache hand values.

## Architecture Notes

This example provides **three complementary implementations**:

### 1. Simple Single-Player (`game.js`)
- **Purpose**: Learning and simple use cases
- **Features**: Single player vs dealer, optional betting
- **Best for**: CLI games, tournaments, AI training
- **Complexity**: Low - direct approach with minimal abstractions

### 2. Advanced Multi-Agent (`multiagent-game.js`)
- **Purpose**: Production-ready multi-player games
- **Features**: 2-6 agents, networking, CRDT state sync
- **Best for**: Multiplayer games, networked play, complex scenarios
- **Complexity**: Higher - uses full Engine/Agent/CRDT architecture

### 3. Web UI (`web/`)
- **Purpose**: Browser-based play experience
- **Features**: Full casino experience, all side bets, PWA support, sound effects
- **Best for**: End users, demos, playing without setup
- **Complexity**: Medium - uses bundled game logic with vanilla JS UI

Choose the right one for your needs:
- **Learning HyperToken?** Start with `game.js`
- **Building a multiplayer game?** Use `multiagent-game.js`
- **Just want to play?** Use `cli.js` or the Web UI
